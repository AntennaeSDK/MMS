# MMS Architecture

The client apps run on real-world networks and user owned hardware. The QoS on real-world networks are unpredictable, based several factors such as location, ISP, Wireless provider, peak times, load on the network etc. On the other hand, service applications are hosted within a datacenter, where hardware, capacity, network are under control of the application owner.

# MMS Mobile Messaging Server

MMS acts as bridge between client apps and server apps, while abstracting the complexities of real-world networks from server applications.

# Architecture

MMS acts as a bridge between client apps (mobile/web/iot) and server apps running in the datacenter. The client apps run on real-world networks and user owned hardware. The QoS on real-world networks are unpredictable, based several factors such as location, ISP, Wireless provider, peak times, load on the network etc. On the other hand, service applications are hosted within a datacenter, where hardware, capacity, network are under control of the application owner.

## Setup

Java 8 should be installed.
